Testing Framework: JUnit.
This project focuses on implementing a modular testing structure for a series of individual exercises, each designed to cover various aspects of software development.

Key Features:

Modular Design: Each exercise is contained within its own directory, promoting clear separation of concerns and independent testing.
Focused Testing: Each exercise utilizes a dedicated test class to verify the functionality of the implemented component.
Diverse Topics: Exercises cover various aspects like embedded databases, JDBC repositories, and service layers, providing a comprehensive learning experience.
Testing Strategies: Different testing techniques are employed, including mock objects and stubs, to isolate components and verify specific functionalities.
Project Structure:

Source Code:
Contains implementation code for each exercise, categorized by their respective folders.
Test Code:
test/java: Dedicated folder for all test classes, organized similarly to the source code.
Overall, this project demonstrates the application of best practices in software testing by:

Separating concerns and promoting modularity through individual exercise folders.
Implementing dedicated test classes to ensure the correctness and functionality of each component.
Utilizing diverse testing techniques to comprehensively evaluate the implemented features.
By engaging in these exercises, developers can gain valuable experience in writing clean, testable code while solidifying their understanding of key software development concepts.
